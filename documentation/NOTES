DESCRIPTION
-----------

The SMC100CC and SMC100PP are Single-Axis Motion Controllers/Drivers for 
DC or Stepper Motors.


BRIEF
-----

These motor drivers communicate to EPICS using RS232.  The motor drivers 
however, can be chained together using a local RS485.  


INSTALLATION
------------

When adding a SMC100PP to an existing chain, you must first set the RS485 
address.  The SMC.exe utility program that comes with the drives provides this 
functionality.  See "3.2 Communication Settings" on page 9, for the port 
settings required to talk to the driver.  See "3.4.1 Controller Address 
Setting" on page 12, to set the address.
